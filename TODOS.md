# TODOS

Organized by component, then priority (P0 highest → P4 lowest). Completed items
move to the bottom.

## Chain Verification

These are the real production blockers. The engine state machine (`runSwap`) and
UTXO coin-selection math are unit-tested, but in-sandbox signing/broadcast for each
pair runs only in the Lit runtime and is not covered by the Node tests.

- **Verify in-sandbox signing/broadcast on live for the remaining pairs**
  **Priority:** P1
  Done live: EVM↔EVM (Base mainnet), EVM↔BTC (Base mainnet ↔ signet), and
  EVM↔SOL (Base mainnet ↔ Solana devnet — swap 13, 2026-06-07), full settle path;
  `derive` mode verified live for all 11 pairs. Still need a live settle: the
  Zcash pairs, the remaining Solana pairs (btc-sol, zec-sol), and Bitcoin↔Litecoin
  / Bitcoin↔Dogecoin. (LTC/DOGE reuse the same UTXO leg as BTC, and btc-sol/zec-sol
  reuse the now-proven SOL leg, so they're lower-risk.)

- **EVM chains excluded pending live verification (re-enable after a funded test)**
  **Priority:** P2
  When the top-30 EVM chains were added, 6 were held back from the selectable set
  (`networks.js` CHAINS + the dropdown in `app/lib/chains.js`) because their
  settlement path isn't proven on-chain. The 24 shipped chains all use the proven
  standard path (EIP-1559 type-2 tx + 21000 native-transfer gas, same as the live
  Base/Ethereum settlements). The excluded 6, and why:
  - **zksync-era (324)** — native account-abstraction tx format; `micro-eth-signer`
    can't produce a tx it accepts. Needs real engine work (a zkSync tx builder),
    not just config. Keep out until then.
  - **arbitrum (42161)** — Arbitrum meters the L1 calldata cost as L2 gas UNITS, so
    a native transfer needs far more than 21000 gas. The engine supports a per-chain
    `nativeGasLimit` (set 3_000_000 when re-adding); the exact need scales with the
    live L1 base fee, so confirm a real transfer doesn't run out of gas.
  - **aurora (1313161554), kava (2222), metis (1088), polygon-zkevm (1101)** —
    no EIP-1559 `baseFeePerGas` (confirmed by `node test/rpc-smoke.mjs`), so a
    type-2 tx is rejected. The engine supports `txType: 'legacy'` (type-0); set it
    when re-adding. Aurora may ALSO need a `nativeGasLimit` (NEAR-backed gas).

  Engine support for both fixes (`txType:'legacy'`, `nativeGasLimit`) is implemented
  and unit-tested (`test/evm-tx-type.test.js`) but currently latent — no shipped
  chain sets either field. **Re-enable steps per chain:** (1) add the entry back to
  `networks.js` with the right `txType`/`nativeGasLimit`, (2) add it to the dropdown
  group in `app/lib/chains.js`, (3) remove it from the `EXCLUDED` guard in
  `test/chains-registry.test.js`, (4) run one live funded settlement and confirm
  both legs land. `node test/rpc-smoke.mjs` re-checks RPC liveness + 1559 support.

- **Wire a live Zcash provider for the ZEC pairs**
  **Priority:** P1
  ZIP-243 shim is verified on regtest only. `evm-zec`, `btc-zec`, `zec-sol`,
  `zec-ltc`, `zec-doge` need a live provider before production.

- **Litecoin testnet verification**
  **Priority:** P2
  `evm-btc` is now verified live on signet. `btc-ltc` and `btc-sol` still need a
  live run (same UTXO leg as BTC, just different network params).

- **Production: raise confirmation depth past 1 on UTXO chains + enforce a floor**
  **Priority:** P2
  The confirmation gate (engine `runSwap`) honors the swap's `confirmationBlocks`,
  but the solver hardcodes `1` at `createSwap` (`app/solver-app.js`) and the
  contract enforces no minimum. One confirmation is fine on signet/testnet but
  shallow for Bitcoin/LTC/DOGE mainnet (1-block re-orgs happen). Before mainnet:
  set a chain-family-aware default (e.g. 3–6 for BTC/LTC, higher for DOGE) and add
  a contract-side `require(confirmationBlocks >= MIN)` for UTXO/ZEC legs so a swap
  can't be created with a gate-disabling `0`. (Adversarial review F1+F2, 2026-06-07.)

- **Confirmation-wait budget is per-swap, not per-leg**
  **Priority:** P3
  `MAX_CONF_WAITS` in the solver step loop is one counter shared across both legs;
  a two-UTXO-leg swap (btc-ltc, btc-doge) that confirms one leg slowly can exhaust
  the budget before the second leg is polled to depth. Scale the budget by the
  number of confirmation-gated legs, or track per-leg. Funds still recover via the
  expiry refund, so this is a liveness/UX issue, not a loss. (Adversarial review F6.)

- **Dogecoin testnet + broadcast API**
  **Priority:** P2
  `btc-doge` needs testnet verification and a DOGE broadcast API.

- **Solana devnet verification**
  **Priority:** P2
  `evm-sol` is now VERIFIED LIVE (Base mainnet ↔ devnet, swap 13, 2026-06-07 —
  settle + sweep + signed receipt, no funds stranded). `btc-sol` and `zec-sol`
  still need a live run (same SOL leg, now proven; btc-sol is zero-mainnet-spend:
  signet + devnet). Note: public devnet faucet was rate-limited/dry — funding the
  action's SOL deposit needed an external airdrop (faucet.solana.com needs GitHub
  auth).

## Web App (UI)

- **Deeper consumer UX pass: single guided swap flow**
  **Priority:** P2
  Collapse the 5 tabs (Create / Status / Execute / Gas Preview / Verify CID) into
  one guided swap-card flow with progressive disclosure, per the design vision.
  Reference mockup: `~/.gstack/projects/cross-chain-settlement/designs/swap-app-20260604/finalized.html`.

- **Self-host General Sans if a CSP locks font origins**
  **Priority:** P3
  General Sans loads from the Fontshare CDN. If font sources are locked down,
  self-host it. Do not fall back to Inter (see `DESIGN.md`).

## Two-Sided Market (RFQ)

The two-sided market (signed-intent + solver-builds-swap) shipped on `GTC6244/seattle`.
Full plan: `docs/plans/two-sided-rfq-plan.md`. Remaining is deployment + live
verification (see Chain Verification) and the phase-2 items below.

- **Phase-2: competitive price auction**
  **Priority:** P3
  v1 competition is "each solver builds a swap with its quote; user funds the best."
  Real price discovery, but each quote costs the solver gas. A formal on-chain timed
  auction or off-chain RFQ relay would tighten spreads. Deferred until solver behavior
  is observed in v1.

- **Phase-2: gasless quote channel**
  **Priority:** P3
  Today a solver pays gas to `createSwap` even for a quote the user doesn't pick. A
  signed-quote relay (solver posts a signed offer, only the winning quote hits the
  chain) removes that cost and lowers the barrier to quoting. Depends on the v1 model
  shipping first.

- **Phase-2: real-time order book (push instead of poll)**
  **Priority:** P3
  v1 order book is a client-side `getLogs` scan on an interval + manual refresh, with a
  visible "some may be missing — rescanning" state on RPC range limits. A websocket /
  push feed (or a light indexer) would make it live. Keep the no-backend constraint in
  mind — evaluate public relays before standing up a server.

## Tooling / QA

- **Build the gstack browse + design binaries**
  **Priority:** P3
  Enables automated viewport screenshots during `/ship` and `/design-review`
  (currently skipped — binaries not built, so UI changes need manual eyeballing).

## Completed

- **Production: confirmation pass for UTXO/ZEC legs before finalize** — added a confirmation gate in `runSwap`: once both legs are settled and the fee is paid, each leg that exposes `confirmations()` (UTXO + ZEC) must reach the swap's `confirmationBlocks` depth before the terminal `markExecuted`. EVM legs are skipped (nonce ordering already protects them). Fail-closed: a lookup error/throw counts as 0 confirmations and defers finalize, never passes an unconfirmed payment through. New `confirmations()` on the UTXO leg (esplora `/tx/:id/status` + tip, or blockchair) and ZEC leg (zcashd `getrawtransaction`/insight). Solver app re-invokes on `awaiting_confirmations` (own wait budget, ~8 min). Late-fail recovery is the existing expiry refund. Engine tests +5. (Also fixed a latent `MAX_INVOCATIONS` ReferenceError in the solver step loop.) **Completed:** 2026-06-07
- **Production: leg RPC injected via params, action CID is key-free** — `makeEvmLeg` now prefers `params.legRpcUrls[chain]` over the embedded default; `networks.js` `base` rpc is a key-free public node (`base-rpc.publicnode.com`); the dead `EVM_RPC` embed was removed. Solver app passes `legRpcUrls: CHAIN_RPC`. A generated base-mainnet action carries no API key (verified). **NOTE:** the old Alchemy key was committed in `1788def` (on `main`) — it is in git history and MUST be rotated. **Completed:** 2026-06-07
- **First live cross-chain settlement: EVM↔BTC** — Base mainnet (EVM) ↔ signet (BTC), both legs settled + signed receipt; real signet tx broadcast (first live `@scure/btc-signer` exercise). **Completed:** 2026-06-05
- **First live EVM↔EVM settlement on Base mainnet** — full settle path (both legs, fee, markExecuted, signed receipt). **Completed:** 2026-06-05
- **One-step-per-invocation engine (HTTP-frugal)** — fixed the intermittent 500s (Lit sandbox ~24-call HTTP cap); each `execute` does one step, caller invokes-then-polls. Solver app updated. **Completed:** 2026-06-05
- **Live-execution bug fixes** — derive-mode crash, UTXO `pubECDSA` rename, EVM signer `undefined` data field. **Completed:** 2026-06-05
- **Contract deployed to Base mainnet** — `0xC0a9c217e643DbdF1b6195a18C0802a1231507A1`, wired into `app/lib/contract.js`. **Completed:** 2026-06-05
- **Two-sided market: user + solver apps (signed-intent + solver-builds-swap)** — contract `announceIntent`/`createSwap`, engine 4-address mapping + floor assert, shared `app/lib/*`, `index.html` + `solver.html`, deploy script. **Completed:** 2026-06-05
- **F1: four-address model (latent cross-chain bug)** — `SwapContract.sol` + `engine.js` + mapping tests. **Completed:** 2026-06-05
- **Inputs bumped to 16px (no iOS zoom-on-focus)** — `app/settled.css`. **Completed:** 2026-06-05
- **"Settled" design system + consumer re-skin** — DESIGN.md, app/index.html, CLAUDE.md. **Completed:** 2026-06-04
- **Custody-model copy corrected to TEE + root-of-trust** — README.md + UI. **Completed:** 2026-06-04
